- 👋 Hi, I’m @mslillyg
- 👀 I’m interested in communication and the arts; I enjoy learning about IT tools and processes and discovering new ways to use them for the arts communities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity and some minor coding. I'd really like to learn how to create an app. I have several ideas for apps that I would love to explore and create for the sheer joy of learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning, basically. I am going to sign up for some available classes and get busy; I'll probably be asking for help before I finish this file!
- 📫 How to reach me I'm not sure I want to put my email address out there for the bots?
